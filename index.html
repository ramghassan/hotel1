              <h1>DOSA</h1>
              <p>Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars or saturated fats. As its key ingredients are rice and urad dal, it is also a good source of protein.The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.There are also instant mix products for making dosa which usually contain higher amounts of rice and therefore have lower nutritional benefits. Since Dosa is considered a high glycemic index food they should be avoided by diabetics.
